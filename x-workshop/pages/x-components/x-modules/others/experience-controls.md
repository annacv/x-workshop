### **Experience Controls**

#### This module aims to allow the implementation of some configuration settings outside the application.

The Experience Controls Module is coupled to the Empathy's Instance Management Console. IMC enables users to manage Vectors/Semantics search and connect it to X-Components to change their behavior. These settings can be activated or deactivated to suit temporary business needs without implementing this logic in the code itself.

The module has a [dedicated component](https://github.com/empathyco/x/blob/main/packages/x-components/src/x-modules/experience-controls/components/experience-controls.vue) that receives a list of events and emits them.
